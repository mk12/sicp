Welcome to my study website for <cite>[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp]</cite>, also known as the Wizard Book. SICP is a [timeless classic] and one of my favorite books.

Here you will find my study notes and solutions to the exercises. The code is written in an [R6RS]-based language that isolates each section of the book to a module with explicit dependencies. It works in [Chez], [Guile], and [Racket].

Enjoy!
