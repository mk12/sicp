Welcome to my study website for [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp], also known as the Wizard Book. SICP is a [timeless classic][] and one of my favorite books.

Here you will find my study notes and thoroughly tested exercise solutions written in portable [R6RS Scheme][r6rs].

My notes are available under the same license as SICP itself, [CC-BY-SA 4.0][cc]. Everything else, including the exercise solutions and the code that builds this website, is MIT-licensed.

Enjoy!
