Welcome to my study website for [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp], also known as SICP or the Wizard Book. I started reading it in during my high school computer science class in 2012, and as of 2020 I'm still chipping away at it.

My notes are available under the same license as SICP itself, [CC-BY-SA 4.0][cc]. Everything else, including my exercise solutions and the code that builds this website, is MIT-licensed.
