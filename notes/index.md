Welcome to my study website for [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp], also known as SICP or the Wizard Book. First published in 1985, it is a classic computer science text that is still relevant today. Whether you're just starting out or a longtime professional, SICP has plenty of wisdom to offer.

My notes are available under the same license as SICP itself, [CC-BY-SA 4.0][cc]. Everything else, including my exercise solutions and the code that builds this website, is MIT-licensed.

Enjoy!
