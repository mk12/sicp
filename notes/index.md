Welcome to my study website for <cite>[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp]</cite>, also known as the Wizard Book. SICP is a [timeless classic][] and one of my favorite books.

Here you will find my study notes and solutions to the exercises. The code is written in a [DSL][] built on [R6RS Scheme][r6rs] that makes each section of the book a module with explicit dependencies. It works in [Chez][], [Guile][], and [Racket][].

This site is available under the same license as SICP itself, [CC BY-SA 4.0][cc].

Enjoy!
