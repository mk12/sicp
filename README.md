# SICP Exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises from [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp], written in [Chez Scheme][].

For the exercises that ask for mathematical proofs, I have prepared ConTeXt documents. The compiled PDFs are also included in this repository. For diagrams that are to tedious to do in ASCII, I have included photos of whiteboard drawings.
