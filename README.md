# SICP Exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises from _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. I am using [Gambit Scheme][1] rather than MIT/GNU Scheme, so there are some slight differences with respect to built-in procedures (usually just their names). On OS X, you can get Gambit Scheme using [Homebrew][2]:

	$ brew install gambit-scheme

This will install the REPL `gsi` and the compiler `gsc`.

For the exercises that ask for mathematical proofs, I have prepared ConTeXt documents. The compiled PDFs are also included in this repository. For diagrams that are to tedious to do in ASCII, I have included photos of whiteboard drawings.
