# SICP Exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises from [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp], written in [Chez Scheme][].

For the exercises that ask for mathematical proofs, I have prepared ConTeXt documents. The compiled PDFs are also included in this repository. For diagrams that are to tedious to do in ASCII, I have included photos of whiteboard drawings.

## Usage

First, install [Chez Scheme][]. On macOS, you can run `brew install chezscheme`.

Then, run `./main.scm --help` to see the options.
