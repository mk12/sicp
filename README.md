# SICP Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_][sicp]. It is written in portable [R6RS][] Scheme, tested with [Chez Scheme][], [Guile][], and [Racket][].

## Usage

Use `./run.sh chez`, `./run.sh guile`, or `./run.sh racket` depending on which Scheme implementation you have installed.

To see the options, pass `--help`. For example, `./run.sh chez --help`.

## Structure

The program starts in `main.scm`. Each chapter of the book has its own file in [src/](src), written in a [custom DSL](#dsl).

For exercises requiring proofs, I have written ConTeXt documents in [proofs/](proofs).

For exercises requiring diagrams, I have used ASCII art in comments or stored whiteboard photos in [whiteboard/](whiteboard).

## DSL

Lightweight testing using the `=>` and `~>` infix operators:

```scheme
(+ 1 1) => 2        ; This asserts that (+ 1 1) evaluates to 2
1 => 1 => 1         ; The operator can be chained
(+ 1.0 0.1) ~> 1.1  ; Use ~> for inexact numbers (allows a small margin of error)
```

Chapter, section, subsection, and exercise headings without nesting:

```scheme
(Chapter 1 "chapter title")

(define a 1)  ; This belongs to Chapter 1

(Section 1.1 "section title")

(define b 2)  ; This belongs to Section 1.1

(Subsection 1.1.1 "subsection title")

(define c 3)  ; This belongs to Subsection 1.1.1

(Exercise 1.1)

(define d 4)  ; This belongs to Exercise 1.1
```

Importing from other segments:

```scheme
(Section 1.1 "first section"
  (use (1.2 square)))     ; import square from Section 1.2

(define nine (square 3))  ; ok
(define eight (cube 2))   ; ERROR, 'cube' not defined

(Section 1.2 "second section")

(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(Exercise 1.15
  (use 1.2))              ; import * from Section 1.2

(define a (+ (square 3) (cube 4)))  ; ok

(Exercise 1.16
  (use ex-1.2))           ; ex-1.2 means Exercise 1.2, not Section 1.2
```
