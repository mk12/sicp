\startproblem
Show that the golden ratio \p{} (Section 1.2.2) is a fixed point of the
transformation $x\mapsto 1+1/x$, and use this fact to compute \p{} by means of
the \code{fixed-point} procedure.
\stopproblem
The golden ratio \p{} is the positive real number that satisfies
\startformula
\p = 1 + \frac{1}{\p}.
\stopformula
Multiplying by \p{}, we get another property of the golden ratio:
\startformula
\p^2 = \p + 1.
\stopformula
\startproof
We would like to prove that each transformation $x\mapsto 1+1/x$ causes the
value of $x$ to become closer to \p{}. Given an initial guess $x>1$, let
$y=1+1/x$ be the improved guess. We must prove that $\abs{y-\p} < \,\abs{x-\p}$.
To begin, we will simplify the left-hand side of the inequality:
\startformula\startalign
\NC \abs{y-\p} \NC = \abs{1+\frac1x-\p} \NR
\NC \NC = \abs{\frac{x+1-\p x}{x}} \NR
\NC \NC = \abs{\frac{x+1-(1+1/\p)x}{x}} \NR
\NC \NC = \abs{\frac{x+1-x-x/\p}{x}} \NR
\NC \NC = \abs{\frac{\p-x}{x\p}} \NR
\NC \NC = \frac{\abs{x-\p}}{\abs{x\p}}.
\stopalign\stopformula
We now have a relation between $\abs{y-\p}$ and $\abs{x-\p}$. To prove that
$\abs{y-\p}<\abs{x-\p}$, we must show that $\abs{x\p}>1$, because dividing the
original error by a number greater than one will produce a smaller value as the
new error. We already stipulated that $x>1$, and we know the value of the golden
ratio is $\p=(1+\sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.618 > 1$, therefore $x\p>1$ and $\abs{x\p}>1$.

Since $\abs{xp}>1$ and $\abs{y-\p} = \abs{x-\p}/\abs{xp}$, we have
\startformula
\abs{y-\p}<\abs{x-\p},
\stopformula
therefore each transformation $x\mapsto y$ brings $x$ closer to \p{}, and
consequently \p{} is a fixed point of the transformation $x\mapsto 1+1/x$.
