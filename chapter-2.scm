;; Under the assumption of small percent tolerances, there is a simple formula

;; are positive, we have
;;     [a,b] Ã— [c,d] = [ac,bd].
;; We can define a single interval in terms of its centre and percentage:
;;     i = [c-cp/100,c+cp/100].
;; Factoring out the centre gives us
;;     i = [c(1-p/100),c(1+p/100)],
;; And multiplying two intervals can now be written as
;;     ij = [ci*cj(1-pi/100)(1-pj/100),ci*cj(1+pi/100)(1+pj/100)].
;; We can expand the bracketed factors:
;;       (1-pi/100)(1-pj/100)
;;     = 1 - pi/100 - pj/100 + pi*pj/10000
;;     = 1 - (pi+pj)/100 + pi*pj/10000.
;;       (1+pi/100)(1+pj/100)
;;     = 1 + pi/100 + pj/100 + pi*pj/10000
;;     = 1 + (pi+pj)/100 + pi*pj/10000.
;; We can substitute this back into the interval multiplication:
;;     ij = [ci*cj(1-(pi+pj)/100+pi*pj/10000),ci*cj(1+(pi+pj)/100+pi*pj/10000)].
;; Since pi and pj are small, we can drop the pi*pj/10000 terms:
;;     ij = [ci*cj(1-(pi+pj)/100),ci*cj(1+(pi+pj)/100)].

;; Yes, Eva is right. The interval calculation system produces different
;; intervals for mathematically equivalent expressions. When the expressions are
;; written in such a form that no uncertain variable is repeated, the
;; uncertainty of the result is smaller, and this is the more correct value.
;; This is because, when an uncertain variable is repeated, the interval
;; arithmetic procedures have no way of knowing that they are dealing with the
;; same value twice. They introduce uncertainty in multiple places as if the
;; repetitions were separate measurements. For example, If we manipulate an
;; algebraic expression by dividing a value by itself, we introduce error
;; because the interval arithmetic division does not produce exactly one.

;;; ex 2.16
;; In general, equivalent expressions may lead to different answers because
;; identical intervals are treated indepedently even if they represent the same
;; measurement. This is called the _dependency problem_. For complicated
;; functions, it is not always possible to eliminate repetitions of an interval
;; in the expression, so there is an unwanted expansion in the resulting
;; intervals. It is not possible to write an interval arithmetic package that
;; does not have this shortcoming. The best we can do is attempt to rewrite
;; expressions so that intervals are not repeated (not always possible).

;; call to get the set of positions for the k-1 case. The original procedure
;; evaluates the enumeration multiple times, which does not significantly affect
;; performance. Evaluating the rercusive call multiple times is wasteful. Louis
;; Reasoner could still use the interchanged version if he bound the value of
