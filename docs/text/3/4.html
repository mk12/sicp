<h1>
Concurrency: Time Is of the Essence<small class="number">3.4</small>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>The power of stateful computational objects comes at a price: the loss of referential transparency.</li>
<li>This gives rise to a thicket of questions about sameness and change, and we had to create a more intricate evaluation model.</li>
<li>The central issue is that by introducing assignment we are forced to admit <em>time</em> in the computational model.</li>
<li>We can go further in structuring the model to match the world: in the physical world, we perceive simultaneous changes.</li>
<li>We want computational processes executing <em>concurrently</em>.</li>
<li>Writing programs this way forces us to avoid inessential timing constraints, making the program more modular.</li>
<li>It can also provide a speed advantage on multicore computers.</li>
<li>The complexities introduces by assignment become even more problematic in the presence of concurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3.4.1" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.1">#</a>The Nature of Time in Concurrent Systems<small class="number">3.4.1</small>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the surface, time is straightforward: it is an ordering.</li>
<li>Two events either occur in one order, or the other, or simultaneously.</li>
<li>Consider <code class="sourceCode scheme">(<span class="kw">set!</span> balance (<span class="op">-</span> balance amount))</code>. There are three steps: accessing the value of <code>balance</code>, computing the new balance, and setting <code>balance</code> to this value.</li>
<li>Two such expressions executed concurrently on the same <code>balance</code> variable could have their three steps interleaved.</li>
<li>The general problem is that, when concurrent processes share a state variable, they may try to change it at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4.1.1" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.1.1">#</a>Correct behavior of concurrent programs
</h3>
<ul>
<li>We already know we have to be careful about order with <code>set!</code>.</li>
<li>With concurrent programs we must be especially careful.</li>
<li>A very stringent restriction to ensure correctness: disallow changing more than one state variable at a time.</li>
<li>A less stringent restriction: to ensure that the system produces the same result as if the processes had run sequentially in some order (we don’t specify a particular order).</li>
<li>Concurrent programs are inherently <em>nondeterministic</em>, because we don’t what order of execution its result is equivalent to, so there is a set of possible values it could take.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3.4.2" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2">#</a>Mechanisms for Controlling Concurrency<small class="number">3.4.2</small>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>If one process has three ordered events <span class="math inline">(a,b,c)</span> and another, running concurrently, has three ordered events <span class="math inline">(x,y,z)</span>, then there are twenty ways of interleaving them.</li>
<li>The programmer would have to consider the results in all twenty cases to be confident in the program.</li>
<li>A better approach is to use mechanisms to constrain interleaving to ensure correct behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4.2.1" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2.1">#</a>Serializing access to shared state
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serialization groups procedures into sets such and prevents multiple procedures in the same set from executing concurrently.</li>
<li>We can use this to control access to shared variables.</li>
<li>Before, assignments based on a state variables current value were problematic. We could solve this with the set {<code>get-value</code>, <code>set-value!</code>, and <code>swap-value!</code>} where the latter is defined like so:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="ex">define</span><span class="fu"> </span>(swap-value! f)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  (set-value! (f (get-value))))</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3.4.2.2" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2.2">#</a>Serializers in Scheme
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Suppose we have a procedure <code>parallel-execute</code> that takes a variable number of arguments that are procedures of no arguments, and executes them all concurrently.</li>
<li>We construct <em>serializers</em> with <code>(make-serializer)</code>.</li>
<li>A serializer takes a procedure as its argument and returns a serialized procedure that behaves like the original.</li>
<li>Calls to the same serializer return procedures in the same set.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4.2.3" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2.3">#</a>Complexity of using multiple shared resources
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serializers are powerful, and easy to use for one resource.</li>
<li>Things get much more difficult with multiple shared resources.</li>
<li>Suppose we want to swap the balances in two bank accounts:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="ex">define</span><span class="fu"> </span>(exchange acc1 acc2)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  (<span class="kw">let</span> ((diff (<span class="op">-</span> (acc1 &#39;balance) (acc2 &#39;balance))))</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    ((acc1 &#39;withdraw) diff)</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    ((acc2 &#39;deposit) diff)))</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Serializing deposits and withdrawals themselves is not enough to ensure correctness.</li>
<li>The exchange comprises four individually serialized steps, and these may interleave with a concurrent process.</li>
<li>One solution is to expose the serializer from <code>make-account</code>, and use that to serialize the entire exchanging procedure.</li>
<li>We would have to manually serialize deposits, but this would give us the flexibility to serialize the exchanging procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4.2.4" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2.4">#</a>Implementing serializers
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Serializers are implemented in terms of the primitive <em>mutex</em>.</li>
<li>A mutex can be <em>acquired</em> and it can be <em>released</em>.</li>
<li>Once acquired, no other acquire operations can proceed until the mutex is released.</li>
<li>Each serializer has an associated mutex.</li>
<li>A serialized procedure (created with <code class="sourceCode scheme">(s proc)</code> where <code>s</code> is a serializer) does the following when it is run:
<ul>
<li>acquire the mutex,</li>
<li>run the procedure <code>proc</code>,</li>
<li>release the mutex.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The mutex is a mutable object, represented by a <em>cell</em> (a one-element list). It holds a boolean value, indicating whether or not it is currently locked.</li>
<li>To acquire the mutex, we test the cell. We wait until it is false, then we set it to true and proceed.</li>
<li>To release the mutex, we set its contents to false.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4.2.5" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2.5">#</a>Deadlock
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even with a proper implementation of mutexes and seralizers, we still have a problem with the account exchanging procedure.</li>
<li>We serialize the whole procedure with both accounts so that an account may only participate in one exchange at a time.</li>
<li>There are two mutexes, so it is possible for something to happen in between acquiring the first and the second.</li>
<li>If we exchange <code>a1</code> with <code>a2</code> and concurrently do the reverse exchange, it is possible for the first process to lock <code>a1</code> and the second process to lock <code>a2</code>.</li>
<li>Now both need to lock the other, but they can’t. This situation is called <em>deadlock</em>.</li>
<li>In this case, we can fix the problem by locking accounts in a particular order based on a unique identifier.</li>
<li>In some cases, it is not possible to avoid deadlock, and we simply have to “back out” and try again.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3.4.2.6" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3.4.2.6">#</a>Concurrency, time, and communication
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Concurrency can be tricky because it’s not always clear what is meant by “shared state.”</li>
<li>It also becomes more complicated in large, distributed systems.</li>
<li>The notion of time in concurrency control must be intimately linked to <em>communication</em>.</li>
<li>There are some parallels with the theory of relativity.</li>
