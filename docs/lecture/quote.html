<h1 id="highlights">Highlights</h1>
<p>These are my favorite quotes from each lecture.</p>
<h2 id="1a" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#1a">#</a><a class="link" href="1a.html">Overview and Introduction to Lisp</a><small class="number">1A</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer scientists are in the business of controlling complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1b" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#1b">#</a><a class="link" href="1b.html">Procedures and Processes; Substitution Model</a><small class="number">1B</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>But one of the things he have to learn how to do is to ignore details. The key to understanding complex things is knowing what not to look at, and what not to compute, and what not to think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2b" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#2b">#</a><a class="link" href="2b.html">Compound Data</a><small class="number">2B</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>See, in general, as systems designers, you’re forced with the necessity to make decisions about how you’re going to do things. And in general, the way to retain flexibility is to never make up your mind about anything until you’re forced to do it. The problem is, there’s a very, very narrow line between deferring decisions and outright procrastination. So you’d like to make progress, but also at the same time never be bound by the consequences of your decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I said that computer science is a lot like magic, and it’s sort of good that it’s like magic. There’s a bad part of computer since that’s a lot like religion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3a" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3a">#</a><a class="link" href="3a.html">Henderson Escher Example</a><small class="number">3A</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Lisp is a lousy language for any particular problem. But it’s good for figuring out the right language and embedding that in Lisp. That’s the real power of this approach to design.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The design process is not so much implementing programs as implementing languages. That’s the powerful idea of Lisp.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3b" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#3b">#</a><a class="link" href="3b.html">Symbolic Differentiation; Quotation</a><small class="number">3B</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to make a robust system, it needs to be insensitive to small changes. A small change in the problem leads to a small change in the solution. Don’t solve a particular problem at each level; solve a class of problems in the neighbourhood of the particular problem by building a language suited to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4a" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#4a">#</a><a class="link" href="4a.html">Pattern Matching and Rule-Based Substitution</a><small class="number">4A</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to very good programming, and very good design, is to know what not to think about.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5a" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#5a">#</a><a class="link" href="5a.html">Assignment, State, and Side-Effects</a><small class="number">5A</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We like to think about the world as being made up of independent objects, each having their own state. The idea of objects, changed, and sameness raises deep problems. If you cut off your fingernail, the “before” and “after” of you is enormously different in terms of atoms. You have changed and feel that you are the “same” person, but how do you know that? By introducing assignment and therefore objects, we open ourselves up to all of these philosophical questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5b" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#5b">#</a><a class="link" href="5b.html">Computational Objects</a><small class="number">5B</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When we have multiple names for the same object, they are called aliases. Changing one changes them all. Sometimes sharing is what we want. But inadvertent sharing is a great source of bugs in complicated programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="6a" class="anchor">
<a class="anchor__link link" href="#6a">#</a><a class="link" href="6a.html">Streams, Part 1</a><small class="number">6A</small>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Going back to this fundamental principle of computer science that in order to control something you need the name of it.</p>
