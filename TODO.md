# New to do

- test in all browsers, without JS, without CSS
- favicon
- exercises: add appendix for core.ss etc.
- remove `<!-- DELETE -->` in text.md
- place spell in the right order for `make all`
- finish correcting spelling and adding ignores
- add "spell" to "all" (either after "fmt", or at the end)
    - and only if we're on macOS
- fix "Note:" in chapters 3-5 (see previous item about "Note:")
- fix inline code in blockquotes background
- remove skipping from check-links.py
- perfection:
    - text: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1*
    - lecture: 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b
    - exercise: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
x thought quote stuff was wrong
    x e.g. `(foo ,3) right now the comma is quoted-yellow color (ok)
    x thought (quasiquote foo (unquote 3)), having the "(unquote" yellow was wrong ... but to truly fix that is very hard because say it's 3 quasiquotes deep and only 2 unquotes, then they should stay yellow. Just going to leave as is because I don't use unquotes like that anyway.
+ move notes/pandoc/ to pandoc/
    + and notes/assets to pandoc/assets
+ write a basic markdown linter (for links, and check 200 OK)
    + made check-links.py work with it
+ lua improvements
    + make functions local
    + just "return" instead of "return el"?
+ highlight.c -> highlight.so, fast and perfect, quasiquote etc.
    + eliminate logic of adding "scheme" class
    + delete a lot of the postprocessing in docgen
    + handle vector literal '#(1 2 3)
    + simplify or rename the CSS classes
+ link to :1.3 in ?1.29 should link to "#1.3" (h1 needs id="1.3"), not to "#"
+ remove/change all "Note:"
    + goal here is to fix weird things that needed notes (e.g. the NaN thing), and also reduce red comments (prefer to have rendered in text with links etc.)
    + will still need to fix in later chapters
+ hyphens vs. underscores
    + hyphen: Scheme, Make targets
    + underscores: compile_commands.json, 
+ automatically produce -Wl,-U flags for lua
+ put Lua .so in lib/ not bin/
+ stop using luaposix, just write a C library for it
+ share Lua version between Makefile and deps.sh
+ generate compile_commands.json from Makefile rules
+ make scripts/
    + but only for internal scripts used by makefile
    + wasted lots of time trying to make perfect usage messages for them
    + realized they are internal, so they don't need them
    + keep run.sh, deps.sh, watch.sh at top level with good usage messages etc.
x consider reordering to "Chez, Racket, Guile"
    x no, already fine, sorted alphabetically
+ improve structure around notes/, and reconsider style.css
+ tighter Deno allows, and share them between Makefile and watch.sh
    + can just use `make render.sock`!!
+ `./run.sh all` in parallel
+ use --compile-imported-libaries for chez!!!
+ honor NO_COLOR (and check isatty?)
    + already done, just in run.sh not main.ss
+ improve structure, e.g. tools/ dir, bin/, etc.
+ support debugging for all not just chez
    x except Racket, doesn't really have any CLI debugger
+ don't symlink active.ss, should be able to run in parallel
    + impossible to do dynamically http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/scheme/scheme19.html
    + but maybe could use lookup paths provided on command line?
x should indented comments be rendered same as top-level?
    x no, but use them judiciously; usually it's better to extract to top level
+ in :2.5.3 link to footnote
    x considered having @ always link to textbook like citation [@1a] and links [](@1a)
    x then need different sigil for text/lecture notes, like "%"?
    x no, should avoid links to textbook since I already autolink headings etc.
    + just make [](@#.#.fn##) a special case to link to textbook
+ copyright year 2022
+ nest diagrams etc in li?
    x impossible to do for code because you don't know if following code is part of the last one e.g. (c) or just tests
    + yes, it is possible!
    + also indent in code so it lines up flush (and clearer that you need to indent after a code block to remain in the (a) part of whatever)
+ space between (a), (b) like paragraph breaks
    + just ol[type="a"] since we have 1, 2, 3 steps which should not have space
+ assertion for never terminating
+ subsubsections (x.y.z.w) in code
    + should be real, i.e. `make lint` ensures they are present in text.md
    + but no need to put all of them. e.g. text 1.1.5 has "Applicative order versus normal order", but exercise 1.1.5 just makes these sentences with a colon at the end since adding 1.1.5.{1,2} would just clutter things and require duplicating the imports
    + rules of thumb: use x.y.z.w if (1) there is an exercise in between so you have to do this to get out of the exercise, or (2) the sections are long or (3) significantly different, i.e. not all importing everything from the previous one
    + actually decided to use it in :2.4.3 because it only required a couple imports, and it's nice to be more modular and realize which things are independent
    + in general trying to do it more, but not e.g. in :2.1.1 (rational numbers) because it would cause a cycle
    + include "2.5.3.3 Hierarchies of types in symbolic algebra" even though it's empty
        + there's nothing between it and Exercise 2.92, and both are `<h3>`
        + but it's useful to keep the organization there ... technically could make all exercises `<h4>`...
+ gaps between `;;` paragraphs?
    + gaps con: we use comments to switch between code/prose, makes no sense to switch back to code for a blank line within prose
    + pro gaps: can be more symmetrical
    + decision: add gap only if otherwise there is improper nesting, i.e. the `^;;$` binds two parts together too tightly in a way that is inconsistent with the surroundings
+ highlight inside quoted list e.g. in '(this is a list)
    + diff color than numbers?
    x don't bother quasiquote, too hard
+ fix dot after math wrapping
+ highlight 1/2 as number
+ quotation issues, link to "on denoting" paper
+ HTML tables (Exercise 2.60)
    + remove .odd, style="text-align:left;", etc.
    + tables shouldn't make mobile page scroll
+ use of `=>` etc. in text/lecture (already discussed below)
    + use `â†’` which is converted to the `.sc` class
+ highlight decode-1 as one symbol (added Identifier regex)
+ use ` -- ` for em dashes in .md and .ss
x use a lua writer instead of postprocessing html
    x doesn't seem to be a way to run syntax highlighting this way
    x actually yes, just pandoc.write the code block itself!
    x hard to pass options, meta, doesn't handle the guilemets in inline code somehow
+ automatically move punctuation inside quotation mark with negative space (.tuck)
+ remove deno --no-check if it's the default now (Makefile and watch.sh)
    + put DENO_FUTURE_CHECK=1 in .profile
+ fifo or something instead of --wait for render.sock
+ watch.sh script
+ make vscode should set up deno
+ spellc implement check_scheme
+ make spellc.m interactive
+ guile line numbers
+ don't mutate quoted lists, then use guile compilation
+ deal with the OLD proofs, diagrams
+ add luarocks path
+ fix Makefile/render.ts deadlocks
+ BUG: exercise index.html have "Note on language" `<li>` but it is empty
+ remove html-math-method in config.yml
+ add `wrap: none` to fix assert in docgen
+ Missing space after $cmd|| in deps.sh
x make diagrams self-contained (otherwise disabling CSS, they are a mess)
    x noticed math renders twice with CSS disabled
    x https://gendignoux.com/blog/2020/05/23/katex.html
    x given I can't even make math look like (can't hide the HTML one without css), there's no point in going to all this effort with the diagrams
+ fix linter.c for UTF-8 (had error with exactly 80 chars, but had theta)
+ fix linter.c for ```diagram blocks
+ bug, section number going ABOVE the title in narrow viewport
    + happens in section 2.2 iPhone SE, due to "Hierarchical" being unsplittable
    + also gaps like "building <blank line> abstractions with" because "building" fits but "abstractions" doesn't
    + but float:right nice in some cases, like "Modeling with Mutable Data" where last line extends below the 3.3
    + even with zero margin below .number (which I previously tuned carefully), can still have gaps for big chapter numbers (larger than chapter title font)
    + test text/lecture/exercise on iPhone SE & at @media cutoff
    + chose 410px since iPhone 8 Plus is 414 px
+ box-and-pointer, tree, environment diagrams
    x graphviz
    x https://github.com/asciitosvg/asciitosvg
    + https://ivanceras.github.io/content/Svgbob.html
    + install in deps.sh
    x hashing (don't bother -- too complicated, don't for math)
        x and for longevity, thats what checking in docs/ is for -- it would be easy to extract the SVG from there is svgbob became unavailable
    + extend katex.ts (and rename?) for svgo, svgbob
    + need to use "```svgbob", not "::: svgbob", since with div Pandoc will still parse the inside as Markdown
    + svgo didn't eleminate <g>s until I added `multipass: true`
    x can't use external <marker>s https://stackoverflow.com/q/9233279
        x open bug https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=109212
    + update README
    + max-width, viewBox scaling
    + correct font size, adjust to be centred
    + crop so that margins look right
x run HTML simplifier/minifier inside katex.ts just on the math
    x not worth it, only says 5% (by removing double quotes)
+ consistent backticks for car/cdr/cons
+ remove ` ; NOALIGN` from code blocks on website
+ fix landscape zooming on iPhone
+ investigate way to get 1-5 ordering without recompilation
+ document `capture-output` and `hide-output` in exercise.md
x fix `(+ 1 1) =?> [(* 1 1) "two"]` (getting `attempt to apply non-procedure #<void>`)
    x was just because I redefined `*` later!!
+ remove racket's patch-output hack by using `print-mpair-curly-braces`
+ mention chez fast, racket good error message in exercise.md
+ link to known issues in exercise.md
+ remove paste link from language.md
+ fix scheme linter
+ `=?>` operator instead of `in?`
+ fix assertion failure when building all docs
x html minifier
    x barely has any effect, size is from math spans
x reconsider â†’ in lecture 6a
    x it's fine
+ automatic `&thinsp;` after code, `&hairsp;` between italic "r" and colon
    + May 2022: wasted time thinking this was broken when it (the entity) just doesn't show up in Safari dev tools
+ decide on bold/italic for technicaly terms
    + just using _em_ for everything, simplest
+ fix bug in postprocess (not all inline code is scheme class)
+ implement spell checker using NSSpellChecker
+ better usage messages for C programs
+ mention `cons-stream` and `with-eval` in language.html
+ free lines from getline
+ clang-format C sources
+ decide on `eval`/`apply` headings
+ add all the exercise links mechanically
    + 3.5.2 has the most (example to look at)
+ highlight `=$>` and `=!>` differently
    + actually just `=!>`, in bold red. `=$>` is fine as is
+ don't highlight `div`
+ linkify `paste` IDs
    + https://stackoverflow.com/a/54219536
    + https://owickstrom.github.io/pandoc-emphasize-code/
    + injected HTML with `â€¹` and `â€º`, and omitted `"` since they are not necessary (`make validate` passes) and if I include pandoc coverts to `&quot;`
+ fix headings in language.html
+ fix h3 heading spacing (appears uneven after blockquote/code)
+ have special callout thing at end of text sections with exercise links
+ fixup highlights of `use`, `:1.2`, `?1.2`, etc.
+ finish writeup for exercise/language
+ finish writeup for exercise/index
+ exercise/language heading anchors
+ figure out the whole lua module symbol stuff
+ fix exercise link for 1.7.1, 1.7.2
x decide on styling for exercise headings (tabular numbers makes external link look bad)
    x only looked bad when they were lined up without any content between them
+ implement use-block styling
x links between text & exercise sections
    x no, too confusing
+ different sigil for text/lecture links (since :1.2.3 is exercise section)
+ implement exercise intralinking in lua filter
x problem: subsubsections like 1.2.3.1 do not have right-labels in text, but in exercise numbers are relevant due to imports; but subsubsections (h3) have no underline making number look weird
    x it's fine
+ respond on https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6651 with my katex solution
+ rewrite README
    + mention pandoc, katex, BEM css, deps.sh, emphasize no JS
+ update index.md in light of CC license
+ test in html5 validator https://html5.validator.nu/
+ BUILD EXERCISES DOCS! Then put proofs inline in the Scheme comments, using $$
+ fix highlighting of ~>
+ CC license for sicp Scheme files
+ attribute some citations to Alan Perlis, etc.
+ do citations for inline quotes and block quotes, linking to SICP website (need it for highlights since chapter heading is not specific enough!)
+ section 1.2.6 prevent $n$th from breaking apart
    + at first used [$n$th]{.nowrap}, later removed it and automated "th" the same as punctuation after math
+ attribute lecture quotes to Abelson/Sussman
+ use ellipses without square brackets in quotes
+ pre-rendered math (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/6651)
    + 19/53 (35%) of current HTML files use katex (with exercises fraction will likely go down)
    + just $N$ takes 475 bytes; modest display eqn is 5KB (https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/2194)
    + see Simplenote "KaTeX" for more analysis; tldr pre-rendering is worth it
        + and when gzipped it barely makes a difference
    + then do if code, `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.11.1/katex.min.css">`
    + can use .INTERMEDIATE in make to start/stop js server (to avoid spawning node on EVERY math)
    + try https://deno.land instead of node! (so cool! so fast!)
    + `brew install luarocks`, `luarocks install luasocket`
    + pretty sure unix sockets are what I want https://stackoverflow.com/a/9476248
    + learning difference between stream/datagram unix sockets
    + https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9644251/how-do-unix-domain-sockets-differentiate-between-multiple-clients
    + trouble with Lua in pandoc: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56087697
    + `require "socket.unix"` failed. did `fenv (luarocks path)`, then got error about "Symbol not found: _lua_newuserdatauv"
    + found pandoc's version, 5.3: `pandoc --lua-filter <(echo 'print(_VERSION)') <<< ''`
    + `brew install luaver` and `luaver install 5.3.6` (latest 5.3 https://www.lua.org/versions.html)
    + 2 problems:
        + lua timeout 0 returns immediately if there is nothing ... what I want is blocking recv 1<=s<=1024
            + can either prefix with sizes, or switch to newline endings
            + went with newlines
        + await in the katex.ts loop prevents handling concurrently
            + made fire and forget (well, except catch)
    + working except OS error 22 when -j4 or higher
    + hammer.ts works so I suspect maybe luasocket is buggy
    + nope: found culprit (maybe) https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/master/cli/tests/unit/net_test.ts#L159
    + confirmed on discord that you should `call conn.close()`
    + found luasocket is 3.0-rc1 from 2013 despite many recent commits on GitHub
    + never mind, GH tag is weird, `luarocks --lua-dir=/usr/local/opt/lua@5.3 show luasocket` shows 3.0rc1-2 (most recent non-dev release, from last year)
    + discussion about pandoc and lua modules https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4230
    + lua filters can't use modules with .so files!! https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/3986
    + the situation:
        + luasocket.unix likely buggy
        + pandoc can only use lua modules without .so (that's why cqueues doesn't work)
    + luaposix works and is documented http://luaposix.github.io/luaposix/
    + answered SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65569899
    + remember, can't host katex.min.css b/c it references fonts relatively
    + font size issue: default 1.21em lines up x-height but capitals are really big
+ docgen should have exit status 1 if pandoc fails
+ italicize output or just use ; => comments
    + e.g. lecure 5a pt3, text 2.1.1
    + decided to use `=> 123` like in exercises BUT: always at start of line, never inlined into previous, AND not in cases where each line of the code block is showing a reduction
    + (note: later on changed this, see "â†’" above)
+ fix soureCode C thing (just removed C code since it was inaccurate; &x is not box since it does not allocate) (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4386)
+ reconsider inline code single-word highlighting
    + nice for parity, but:
        + blue functions look like links. and even if I changed color...
        + too distracting in paragraphs with lots of little `things`
            + e.g. text 3.3.1
        + does not help parsing the way code blocks do -- nothing to parse!
        + single word IS nice for the ss underline
        + problem: "the old `car` is unreachable". blue is bad here
+ add guillements in lecture.md
+ with scrolling code, full 80 chars scrolls tiny bit. fix.
x indication that code/math scroll
    x considered gradient fade-out on right. looks bad.
    x StackOverflow keeps scrollback with ::webkit-scrollbar. too hard
+ consistent CSS property ordering https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/
+ fix responsiveness (broken; resizing overflows right edge)
    + bisected by deleting nodes in inspector; culprit is site header
    + with only header, isn't even centred on wide page!
    + ... removed *everything* in body, still weird size
    + OK, reproduced on text/1/2.html
    + dumb! it was just the display math! same with code
    + but before header numbers were overflowing too. Can't reproduce that.
    + make math and code scroll after all.
    + code definitely scroll (and now way to prevent Safari from hiding scroll bars, oh well)
    + math tried before, had vertical scroll bar issue https://stackoverflow.com/q/6421966, https://talk.observablehq.com/t/vertical-scroll-bars-on-display-katex/2304/4, https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/327
    + can fix by adding a tiny bit of padding
    + (would prefer scaling down the math but there's no CSS way to scale text to fit a container)
+ more indentation for nested lists (look at github's indentation)
+ replace % in sicp URLs with %25
+ aria-hidden instead of alt="" for SVGs
+ remove `<span class="sc">Â»</span>`
+ fix scheme.xml numbers
    + `++` means this https://stackoverflow.com/a/4489585
+ remove empty `<a>` tags, classes, spans, etc. in source listings 
    + need to stream pandoc output and modify it in docgen
    + in theory, could be most optimal to write pandoc input in 1 thread and transform its output in another
    + in pratice, I suspect docgen is so fast that it finishes generation before pandoc even gets a chance to open the output file
    + timing: docgen takes 10ms on docs/text/highlight.html (slowest as it scans all text.md)
    + so not worth pipelining this as it will save a few ms at best -- and that's only in the ideal conditions where thread creation + pandoc latency to first byte of output is less than 10ms
    + brought 741450B -> 658270B html, 83KB saving!
x consider if any em should be rem
+ fix spacing between arrows and text
+ decide whether to use article
+ figure out document outline, logo h1 etc.
+ big numbers for chapters
+ fix margins on .nubmer
+ ensure HTML formatting no space in inlines
x use contextual class names instead of SVG file name based
    x nah since the class="..." are in SVG files
+ use grid instead of flexbox for narrow sitenav, and add border-top
+ prettify html output (indentation of SVGs etc)
x use ul in navs
    x if I could use display:contents, ul would be a cinch
    x it's 90%+ but with accessibility bugs ... the very reason to use it
    x going to stick with plain <a>s for simplicity and less bloat
+ fixup lecture.md blurb wording
+ redo pixel-perfect vertical-align
+ make highlights links go directly to textbook/lecture
    + must do this because otherwise "external link" is a lie
+ extract favorite quotes from blockquotes annotated with ::: highlight
+ interlink all highlights

+ refactor docgen with HighlightScanner
+ more links in LICENSE.md
+ make pandoc process die when docgen dies
+ pandoc filter to allow #1, #1.1, #1.1.1, #1a, etc. and convert to 1/1.html#1.1.1 etc.
+ test site with stylesheet disabled
+ remove padding in SVGs, make pixel perfect, attributes/css
+ decide on SVG attribute vs CSS
    + definitely put width/height otherwise disabling CSS creates huge gaps
    + pro of SVG: previewing SVG file is correct
+ rename quote.html to highlight.html
+ add external link icon to indicate header link affordance (and not _blank, just to indicate; precedent here in Wikipedia)
+ linkify all headers

+ change small to span and add space for Safari Reader
+ userspace buffering to avoid so many write(2) calls
+ revamp colors AGAIN, and fix underlines for meta, and revisit 1-word highlight
+ fix contrast in code highlighting (revamp colors)
+ fix `<formal parameters>` etc.
+ use config.yml for pandoc and short options for better Make output
+ optimize SVGs with https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
    + note: not using `<use>` for arrows since they're so small
+ test in Safari, Firefox, Chrome
+ improve accessibility, alt/title text, main tag etc.
+ improve Scheme highlighting in docs (and support dark mode)
+ decide on en/em dashes (going with closed-set em)
x if quotes always included in notes, maybe quote.md should just be references/line numbers/something (and then maybe place back into the main file)
    x too much work
+ dark mode
+ fix monospace in heading, weird spacing
+ fix italics collisions
    + only a problem with "r", so manually added `&hairsp;` in 1.1.5

    x seems to make no difference on helvetica
+ SVG for arrows in pagenav
+ tighten leading on headings without changing margins
+ fix chapter/section numbers when heading wraps
+ distinguish h2/h3 more (especialy matttes in lecture, no numbers on h2)
x decide on frontmatter in TOC or not
    x no, looks bad since it doesn't have number
+ finish homepage
+ licenses (MIT + CC-BY-SA)
+ settle on max-width
    + sticking with 800: want wide enough for SICP drawing; need code 80 chars; want blockquotes to look same as code, meaning same length
+ remove scheme from all ```scheme... insert it auto, also on inline!!
+ put highlight styles in standalone CSS
+ use /text/1#1.2 for section 1.2, /exercise/1#1.32 for Exercise 1.32, etc.
x note: GH pages allows omitting .html (without need for subfolder + index.html)
    x but want it to work locally, so sticking with .html links
x link quotes to the SICP website
    x can't link to precise quote locations so no point.
+ little hash anchors on headings, like github
+ color scheme https://coolors.co/98c1d9-2c497f-db5461-fbb5b1-38302e
+ drawing of wizard book yin/yang for index.hml
x switch to netlify to avoid checking in docs?
    x No, GitHub pages is simpler. No containers, no slow builds. Just HTML.
+ make check for shellcheck (needs to be distinct from lint for vscode task error recognition)
+ change install-foo-package to foo-pkg

+ move study markdown into repo
+ special arrow for output/lines
+ remove debug stuff from core.ss
+ remove --slow
+ assert raises
+ remove make-parameter/parameterize from sicp

# Considered

Assert no exception on `=>`?
no: (1) inconsistent `(foo)` and `(foo) => 'ok`, and will slow down compilation more

# To Do

+ main.scm to run stuff
+ --slow flag

need:
+ use stuff from later chapter
+ sometimes don't override: sqrt
+ sometimes override: real-part

2 approaches:
A semantic (exercise 1.1 ...)
B ability (scope), (check), rest in comments

would like main.scm to show names of exercises...
but B is more flexible.


or:

(section foo)

(exercise 1.1)
(check)

issues:
- defines in check or outside?
- one big check, or many small?
- use (f x) in next section (but not globally)
- define same procedure multiple ways
